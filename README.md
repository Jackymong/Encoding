#Introduction

In machine learning, encoding categorical variables is essential for converting non-numeric data into a format that can be used by models. This repository explores several encoding methods such as Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, Ordinal Encoding, and Hashing Encoding, applied to a sample dataset.
Methods
Null Value Handling

Before applying encoding techniques, we handle missing values in the dataset. We calculate the mean for columns with missing values and replace them.

#For example, in the Transport column:

    We calculate the mean of the column and replace the missing values with this mean.

#Label Encoding

Label encoding assigns a unique numeric value to each unique category in a column. This is useful for ordinal data where the order of categories matters.

For example, we applied label encoding to the Area column, converting categorical values (e.g., 'Dhaka', 'Ctg', 'Rangpur') into numeric labels (0, 1, 2).
#One-Hot Encoding

One-hot encoding creates new binary columns for each category, where a 1 indicates the presence of a category and 0 indicates its absence.

For the Area column, we create binary columns for each of the cities (e.g., 'Dhaka', 'Ctg', 'Rangpur').
#Ordinal Encoding

Ordinal encoding is similar to label encoding but is applied when the categories have a meaningful order. For instance, cities with a ranking can be ordinally encoded (e.g., Dhaka = 0, Ctg = 1, Rangpur = 2).
#Hashing Encoding

Hashing encoding applies a hash function to the categorical variables. This is helpful when dealing with high cardinality categorical features.
#Installation

To run this project, you will need Python 3 and the following libraries:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn category_encoders

#Usage

    Clone this repository:

#git clone https://github.com/yourusername/encoding-techniques.git

    Download the sample dataset agora.csv and place it in the root directory.

    Run the Python script to apply different encoding methods to the dataset.

#python encode_data.py

This template should give a good overview of the encoding techniques used and how they were implemented. You can further expand the sections if needed!
